     * Calculate an inSampleSize for use in a {@link BitmapFactory.Options} object when decoding
     * bitmaps using the decode* methods from {@link BitmapFactory}. This implementation calculates
     * the closest inSampleSize that will result in the final decoded bitmap having a width and
     * height equal to or larger than the requested width and height. This implementation does not
     * ensure a power of 2 is returned for inSampleSize which can be faster when decoding but
     * results in a larger bitmap which isn't as useful for caching purposes.
     *
     * @param options An options object with out* params already populated (run through a decode*
     *            method with inJustDecodeBounds==true
     * @param reqWidth The requested width of the resulting bitmap
     * @param reqHeight The requested height of the resulting bitmap
     * @return The value to be used for inSampleSize
